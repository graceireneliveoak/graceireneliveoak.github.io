											<h4>New Hope, Emergency Housing Shelter for Families Experiencing Homelessness - Overview of Floorplans </h4>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/newhope1.jpg" alt="" /></span>To the left of this text is one of the 3D floorplans I created through Planner5D. During my internship with NewHope, the nonprofit was experiencing a transitional period into new emergency housing sites. These floorplans were used to guide volunteers through the furnishing and modeling of New Hope's brand new housing pods. The site hosts three pods, all of which can house four families, with up to five individuals per family. </p>
											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/newhope2.jpg" alt="" /></span>The image to the right of this text is a focused screenshot of a New Hope study quarter. These study quarters are available in every housing pod; serving the purpose to advance each family's access to internet, and digital education. My time with New Hope remains dear to my heart, and is stored as a core memory as what is possible when geniune love is poured into communities facing homelessness.</p>
